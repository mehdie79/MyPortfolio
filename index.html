						<p> The Beaglepod is able to play music in various formats, while being controlled either locally or remotely. A menu is  displayed on the LCD, that the user can interact with via the joystick. This menu provides options for selecting songs, changing settings, connecting to Bluetooth devices, and various other functionalities.</p>

						<h2> <br> Project Purpose <br><br> </h2>
						<p> The purpose of this project was to gain a comprehensive understanding of developing embedded applications by working with various devices and large systems. Through this project, I aimed to enhance my problem-solving skills and gain a deeper understanding of the tools and devices utilized by embedded developers to create robust applications. </p>
						<h2> <br> Features <br><br> </h2>
						<ul style = "list-style-type: disc;">
							<li> Upload songs in any format using the website and in a few seconds the song name will be displayed on the LCD </li>
							<li> The songs can be switched using the joystic of the beaglebone </li>
							<li> Users can stop, play, or replay a song based on their prefrences </li>
							<li> Users can use bluetooth to connect to speakers to listen to the songs </li>
							<li> The volume can controlled using the potentiometer </li>
						</ul>
						
						<h2> <br> Challenges <br><br> </h2>
						<p> 1. One of the challenges I encountered was coming up with the idea to properly shutdown the device. In
a large-scale system properly cleaning up all the memory and threads used can be a challenging task. So,
by discussing ideas with my teammates I was able to come up with the idea to implement a shutdown
module that reduces the complexity of shutting down the application which helped us save time while
debugging. <br><br> </p>
					<p> 2. Designing a menu manager was challenging since the menu manager must know which menu the user
is currently in to display and properly transition between the menus. Menu manager also uses several
functionalities from other modules which requires you to properly design a code that can correctly
manage all the functionalities available in the system. <br> <br></p>
					<p> 3. Starting to play a song and smoothly transitioning to a new song by stopping the current song and
starting a new one can be a challenging task. This is because the process of starting/changing songs
needs to be as seamless as possible for a better user experience. To address this challenge, I collaborated
with my team through meetings and discussions, and we came up with the idea of designing a song
manager. The song manager module that I implemented is responsible for handling all aspects related to
playing and changing songs. This included the process of loading songs, starting and stopping them, and
transitioning between songs in a seamless manner. It ensures that there are no gaps or glitches in the
audio playback when transitioning between songs, providing a smooth and uninterrupted listening
experience for the user. <br><br></p>

						<p> The main goal of the game Rabbit Trails is to have the rabbit(main character) eat all the carrots(regular rewards) and make it out of the garden(maze) without getting caught by the eagle(moving enemy) or getting trapped into many animal traps(punishment). </p>
					<h2> <br> Project Purpose <br><br> </h2>
					<p> The primary objective of this project was to enhance user engagement in the game by utilizing AI search algorithm specifically, breadth-first search algorithm.  This algorithm was used to determine the shortest path between the main character and the enemy. Over the course of this project, I gained valuable experience in leveraging Java libraries for game development and effectively utilized frameworks such as JUnit to rigorously test the software's functionality.  </p>
					
					<h2> <br> Features <br><br> </h2>
					<ul style = "list-style-type: disc;">
							<li> The main character is controlled using arrow keys, allowing movement in all directions (left, right, up, and down).</li>
							<li> Throughout the maze, regular awards are scattered, which the main character must collect before exiting the maze. </li>
							<li> Bonus awards intermittently appear and disappear randomly within the maze, offering additional rewards. </li>
							<li> The maze also contains punishments that, when collected, reduce the character's score. If the score becomes negative, the main character loses the game.</li>
							<li> Enemies are spread over the maze. They employ the shortest path algorithms to track and pursue the main character, adding an element of excitement to the gameplay. </li>
						</ul>

						<h2> <br>  Challenges  <br><br> </h2>
						<p> 1. One of the challenges of the project was implementation of hit boxes. The game features several distinct objects, including the main character, enemies, walls, rewards, and punishments. Effectively implementing hit boxes for each of these objects was crucial to prevent unwanted collisions. Through rigorous testing, I ensured that the hit boxes were functional . <br><br> </p>
					<p> 2. Another significant challenge I encountered during the project was incorporating an AI search algorithm for enemies to efficiently locate the character by calculating the shortest path. While I had a grasp of AI search algorithms, such as breadth-first search, understanding how to effectively adapt it to my specific use case was challenging. Through extensive research and in-depth comprehension of the algorithm, I successfully overcame this challenge and successfully implemented this feature. <br> <br></p>
					<p> 3. Addressing the implementation of bonus rewards posed another significant challenge in the project. These bonuses have the unique behavior of appearing and disappearing randomly across the game board after a certain time interval. To tackle this, I had to devise a logic that ensured the effective handling of these dynamic elements<br><br></p>

					<p> 1. Debugging a multithreaded application like this one can be challenging and time-consuming due to the simultaneous execution of multiple threads. It requires considering all possible behaviors resulting from this concurrency. <br><br> </p>
					<p> 2. Developing well-designed data structures, such as queues and routines, is crucial and challenging in this project. These data structures play a pivotal role in its success. Code that is thoughtfully designed is not only easier to debug but also simpler to maintain. Through iterative refactoring and revision, was able to achieve well-designed data structures. <br> <br></p>
					
					<p> 3. Addressing memory leaks and ensuring proper memory deallocation at the conclusion of the application posed unique challenges. In a multithreaded environment, multiple threads dynamically allocate and modify memory, making it essential to pay attention to detail. By utilizing tools like Valgrind, was able to  track and address memory leaks, ensuring the application's memory was managed effectively. <br><br></p>
